#NeCTAR Network Status

## Description

Web view of switches and connected hosts, drawn with SVG, and embedded in an HTML page. 

The definitions of switches, hosts and drawing layout needs work, having too much overlap between files. 
Currently
* Switches, and their ports are defined in switches/ and files can be added dynamically
* hosts, and their port are defined in hosts/ and files can be added dynamically
* the SVG drawing layout is defined in rlib/drawing_layout.rb

bin/draw.rb is run to generate the net.svg file.

Port status is generated by bin/gen_host_status.rb and stored in the host_status.json file. This is retrieved from the web server every minute through asynchronous Ajax calls.
